# Hierarchical_Coverage_Path_Planning
#### Complete version of the code can be found at TSPCPP folder.
The training code can be ran by typing the code `python main.py`.

**To do list:** 
1. Increasing the number of features helps training.
2. Compare trained model with the baseline algorithms. Candidates for the algorithms include **LKH, OR-tools, DP, Genetic Algorithm (GA)**.
