# Hierarchical_Coverage_Path_Planning

### To train the model, use the command `python main.py`.
**To do list:** 
- ~~Change the reward function~~: The sign of the reward function depends on the Loss function design. In wouter kool's paper, the loss function is defined with total distance
- ~~Visualize the model performance in real time~~
- ~~Need to retrain the model with a changed mask matrix~~ 
- ~~Changed the loss function; high loss function and low loss function~~
- Change the value of C in the pointer network. C value controls exploration and exploitation.
- Give loss weight in high_loss value: 이렇게 하면 low model을 초기에 더 잘 학습 할 수 있을것이라 생각함.
