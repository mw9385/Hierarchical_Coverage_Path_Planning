# Hierarchical_Coverage_Path_Planning

### To train the model, use the command `python main.py`.
**To do list:** 
1. Increasing the number of features helps training.
2. Compare trained model with the baseline algorithms. Candidates for the algorithms include LKH, OR-tools, DP, Genetic Algorithm (GA). 
3.
